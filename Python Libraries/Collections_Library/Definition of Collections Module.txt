The collection Module in Python provides different types of containers. A Container is an object that is used to store different objects and provide a way to access the contained objects and iterate over them. Some of the built-in containers are Tuple, List, Dictionary, etc.

collections module provides alternatives to Python's general purpose built-in containers like- List, tuple, dict and set.

Different containers provided by the collections module are as follows:-
* Counters
* OrderedDict
* DefaultDict
* ChainMap
* NamedTuple
* DeQue
* UserDict
* UserList
* UserString

Each of these have a different functionality and purpose which we will cover separately.
