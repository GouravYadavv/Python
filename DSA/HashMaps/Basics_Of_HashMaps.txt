Hash maps are indexed data structures. A hash map makes use of a hash function to compute an index with a key into an array of buckets or slots. Its value is mapped to the bucket with the corresponding index. The key is unique and immutable.

In python we have predefined Hash function which we know by the name of Dictionaries.

Hash function is the core of implementing a hash map. It takes in the key and translates it to the index of a bucket in the bucket list. Ideal hashing should produce a different index for each key. However, collisions can occur. When hashing gives an existing index, we can simply use a bucket for multiple values by appending a list or by rehashing.

For each value to get assigned to the key we first initialize the key, which makes our code lengthy. So to overcome this headache of initializing a key again and again we have a special type of dictionary in python known as DefaultDict.

Here we also have some function to retrieve data form the HashMap:
1. hashmap.keys() - It is helpful to get the keys only.
2. hashmap.values() - It is used to get the values assigned to a key.
3. hashmap.items() - It is the combination of the 2 above which is used to get both keys and values assigned to them.
